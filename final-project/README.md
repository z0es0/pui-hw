# **FP1 \- Proposal for Critique**

## Idea Sketches

### *Idea 1: Portfolio*

![sketch of idea 1](images/idea1sketch.png)

*Image description: The three main pages on the portfolio website.*

Description: Personal website/portfolio to showcase my work from my professional career and school. Consists of a homepage, about me page, and individual pages for each project (that follow a similar structure/template).

Motivation: To demonstrate to recuiters my programming and design skills through a polished, creative portfolio website that shows my personality. 

Interactions: 
* Embedded videos and clickable prototypes that allow users to see my design work in motion. 
* Micro-interactions that are enabled through scroll and hover to add dynamicity to the pages.

Accessibility: Follows WCAG standards (at minimum) and other accessibility best practices. Is accessible by desktop, laptop, and mobile.

### *Idea 2: I'm Climb*

![sketch of idea 2](images/idea2sketch.png)

*Image description: The three main pages of the web app, including a login screen, home screen with friends' climbing schedules, and a screen to share your climbing plans with friends*

Description: A mobile-first website that connects rock climbers with each other to schedule dates/times/locations to climb together. Consists of a login, homepage, scheduling page, user accounts, a mechanism to add friends, and stored data on climbing plans.

Motivation: To help my friends coordinate climbing sessions with each other without having to text multiple group chats. 

Interactions & specifics: 
* Login/account credentials saved to a server to remember and share users' data
* A backend way to store users' climbing schedules 
* A way for users to add and remove friends and only see friends' schedules

Accessibility: Follows WCAG standards (at minimum) and other accessibility best practices. Is accessible by desktop, laptop, and mobile.

### *Idea 3*

![sketch of idea 3](images/idea3sketch.png)

*Image description: The main screen of the 3D model viewer with action buttons on the left sidebar*

Description: A web-based 3D model viewer with built-in functions (e.g., navigation, adding markers, etc.) and its own UI.

Motivation: This would be done as research for a project I'm working on outside of class. I would like to learn how to use online resources like libraries to create a standalone 3D model viewer and add different functionalities to it. 

Interactions: 
* The ability to pan, zoom, and move around a 3D model
* The ability to measure distances betweeen selected points
* Add markers or pins to the 3D model with text annotations
* Potentially the ability to measure surface area or volume of a 3D object?

Accessibility: Follows WCAG standards (at minimum) and other accessibility best practices. Is accessible by desktop and laptop (mobile is likely not feasible).

## Feedback Summary

During the lab session, I received valuable feedback on my three project ideas.

For the portfolio website, several peers noted that it is a practical project option. They shared that using markdown files would allow me to efficiently add new projects to the pages, enhancing the site's maintainability and ease of updates.

In contrast, the I’m Climb app garnered mixed reactions. One participant expressed a strong preference for this idea, believing it was feasible with support from teaching assistants and instructors. However, there were concerns regarding the complexity of storing user credentials and managing databases. Christina, our TA, emphasized that creating a functional minimum viable product (MVP) would require significantly more effort, particularly in handling login systems and database integration. Given the five-week timeframe, we ultimately decided that it was unrealistic to develop this idea fully.

Finally, the 3D model viewer received the least enthusiasm from the group. Most participants struggled to understand its purpose, suggesting a disconnect between the concept and its intended users or applications.

## Feedback Digestion

The feedback I received during the lab session significantly influenced my project direction. Christina's insights were particularly insightful. Although the I’m Climb app received a lot of interest, I realized that the technical requirements, especially around user credential management and database functionality, would be too challenging to figure out within the timeline of the project--particularly for someone brand new to programming like myself. This realization prompted me to reassess the feasibility of this project, and I ultimately decided to dismiss the positive attention this proposal received. I definitely share everyone's excitement for the concept and would love to develop it someday, but it simply isn’t feasible for this final project.

Additionally, the group’s lukewarm response to the 3D model viewer highlighted its lack of clarity in purpose and relevance. I have personal reasons why I want to develop the website (for a future work project), but I ultimately wanted to go with something that motivates me now.

Given these considerations, I've chosen to focus on my portfolio website. This option is practical and aligns perfectly with my professional aspirations and recruiting timeline. By developing a portfolio, I can effectively showcase my programming and design skills, presenting my work in a polished manner. This project also allows me to incorporate micro-interactions and create a cohesive template for project detail pages, which are essential for crafting a user-friendly experience. The positive feedback I received about this idea reassured me that it is both achievable and impactful, making it the best choice moving forward. I appreciated the advice on how to organize my code to make my website easily scaled, and will work on finding ways to streamline my code in coming iterations.
